Author's description:

After over one year of basically uploading nothing, I present to you my most anticipated sequel ever:

the happy funny fellas... V2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With nearly every cursor of the set getting a rework or remaster, and multiple different versions of some cursors to fit everyones taste... this happy funny fella set has it all!!!
Each cursor has been painstakingly crafted from the ground up (except the ones that weren't) using expert craftsmanship from a fella that has been honing his technique for years! These fellas went from being crudely drawn to having every pixel analysed. Don't miss out on this opportunity to download these cute and funny fellas they all want to be a part of your pc and they DONT want to perform any neferious and perchance somewhat devious actions.. instead they will keep you company whatever the mood.

Here's a changelog if you're curious:

cursor:
-cleaned up pixels
-changed expression a bit and made it thinner

all the directional resizes:
-cleaned up arrows

error:
-overhalled the sad face into a pout
-added mini cursor for more obvious hotspot

all the link selects:
-overhalled the finger to a more classic link select, but kept the tilt
-reworked person select into a cat
-added optional jumper version for some cozy selects.

working in background:
-kept the animation but used the new cursor

busy:
-this took the longest to work but made the donut basically just more satisfying
-pixel perfect circle
-clean animations

move:
-if you know fonts, i basically made the move from sans serif to serif.
-tidied pixels

handwriting:
-while the happy funny fella is almost invisible to the naked eye, fella is there living a happy life
-colored the rubber of the pencil

text select/precision select:
-unchanged

Alternative selects:
-used new cursor for the 2nd one
-tidied the arrow shape for the 1st one
(btw u can use the alt select 1 instead of precision select I might have mixed them up and stuck to it ehe)
